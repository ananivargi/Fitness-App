# Bodywise Fitness App

## Project Description 
A fitness app in which users can create a profile, and get statistics about their BMI and V02 Max range based on their age and gender. 
I have used the Python GUI Tkinter for the development of this project as it is a simple, user-friendly interface with which I have experience. I also used the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to format images onto the Tkinter window. 

I particularly faced challenges with creation of the front-end as I prefer creating algorithms and back-end logic. This included making the side bar, learning how to incorporate different frames in the window, and adding/aligning images. 
In the future, I would like to implement the Goal Visualiser bar, whereby the user can enter their daily steps, sleep, and calories burned goals, and then the actual values for the day, and a bar graph will appear for each field that helps the user visualise how close they are to achieve their goal, in turn encouraging them to improve fitness by working towards these health goals. I would also implement a 'badge' system which gives users virtual badges for different achievements (such as completing a certain goal daily for a week straight), futher facilitating motivation to gain and maintain fitness. 

## Installation Requirements and Dependancies 

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine along with the following Python packages:

1. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with the standard Python distribution. Some Linux distributions may need it to be installed manually. Tkinter can be installed using the following:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

2. **Pillow**: Pillow is a Python Imaging Library that adds images to Tkinter windows.Pillow can be installed using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

3. **ttk**: ttk is a submodule of Tkinter and is included with the standard Python distribution. No additional installation is required.


### Running the Application
After these dependencies are installed, the application can be run by either pressing the run button on the 'mainapp.py' file, or executing the following command in the Terminal:|

    ```bash
    python mainapp.py
    ```
